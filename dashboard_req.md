## Goal
1. Build a dashboard page according to the below design using HTML/CSS.
2. The page can be developed using any open-source libraries that will help you build a better
application (slight preferences to Angular2/React) but without using Bootstrap.
3. Write clean code and use javascript conventions
(http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp)
4. The design of the application code should be ready for future extensions.
5. You can use any applications icons and any layout as long as the same functionality will be
implemented.
6. In order to ease the development, you can use hardcoded json files in any structure that will
represent data retrieved from the server.
7. The source code and running instructions should be provided for a discussion. The implementer
should assume that this is a production-grade development project.

## Bonus Points

1. Use npm and/or bower.
2. Use gulp for building in order to compress JS, “compile” scss, etc.
3. Use CSS preprocessor language such as scss/less
4. Make the page responsive as possible.
5. Build server-side based on NodeJS in order to serve the applications list and activities to the
client.
